# F1 Scoreboard Plugin

A Formula 1 plugin for LEDMatrix that displays driver and constructor
standings, race results, qualifying and practice times, sprint results,
upcoming races, and the full season calendar — with team-colored visuals,
circuit map art, championship gap bars, favorite driver/team spotlights,
and a live-session auto-refresh mode.

Data is sourced from public ESPN F1 endpoints, Jolpica/Ergast, and OpenF1.
**No API key required.**

## Features

- **Championship leaders card** — split view of the current driver and constructor leaders with team colors and win counts
- **Driver standings** with championship points gap bars and team-color accents
- **Constructor standings** with team logos, gap bars, and per-driver point split (`NOR 189 | PIA 145`)
- **Favorite driver spotlight** — full card for your chosen driver: position, points, gap to leader, team color banner
- **Favorite team spotlight** — team logo, both drivers, constructor position and points
- **Recent race results** — podium cards with winner, P2, P3, gap times, fastest-lap dot, positions-gained delta (`+N`/`-N`), and retirement (`RET`) indicators; plus a dedicated **favorite driver highlight card** showing their position, gap, delta, and points scored when they finish outside the top 3
- **Upcoming race card** — circuit name, country, date, session times, and circuit layout map art; followed by a **circuit stats card** with laps, distance per lap, total race distance, and the official lap record
- **Qualifying results** — Q1 / Q2 / Q3 breakdown with gap-to-pole times
- **Free practice standings** — FP1, FP2, FP3 with lap times
- **Sprint results** — sprint race finishing order and times
- **Season calendar** — upcoming events with color-coded session badges (RACE, QUALI, SPRINT, FP1–3)
- **Standings header card** — F1 logo, season year, round number (Rd N/M), and red season progress bar before each standings section
- **Live session detection** — automatically increases refresh rate when a session is in progress
- Per-element font customization; no API key required

## Display Modes

The plugin registers eight granular modes. The display controller rotates through any that are enabled in your config:

| Mode | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `f1_driver_standings` | Championship standings with gap bars |
| `f1_constructor_standings` | Constructor standings with team logos |
| `f1_recent_races` | Last 1–10 race results (configurable) |
| `f1_upcoming` | Next race card with circuit map and countdown |
| `f1_qualifying` | Q1 / Q2 / Q3 breakdown |
| `f1_practice` | FP1, FP2, FP3 standings |
| `f1_sprint` | Sprint race results |
| `f1_calendar` | Upcoming race schedule |

## Configuration
