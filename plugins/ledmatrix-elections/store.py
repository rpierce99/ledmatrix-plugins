RaceStore: aggregation layer over providers.

Calls each enabled provider, merges their normalized ``Race`` lists into one
unified set, applies the state/race-type filters, sorts by importance, and
diffs against the previous snapshot to detect newly-called races (for interrupt
mode). All logic here is pure and I/O-free so it can be unit-tested directly.
